- I used ReactJS and its related technologies such as Redux Toolkit, React Router.
- I relied on vanilla CSS (no preprocessor) for this project.

### Database

- I chose Firebase because it's simple and fast.

# I'm looking for a fresher opportunity

I am also searching for a React fresher/intern job. I am work-oriented and can self-learn new things quickly. As an ex-marketer, I can also design and write (in both Vietnamese & English) decently. If you have any opportunity, please contact me:
